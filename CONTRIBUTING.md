## How to contribute

### Fix an issue

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/your-fix`
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request

### Add a new chapter

1. Create a new folder following the naming pattern: `07-your-topic/`
2. Include a `README.md` with:
   - A "What you'll learn" box at the top
   - Simple language (assume basic Python, no AI agent experience)
   - A "What's next?" link at the bottom
   - Terminal output examples where relevant
3. Keep it under a 10-minute read
4. Update the table of contents in the root `README.md`

### Style guidelines

- Use plain, direct language
- All prompts in code blocks must be copy-paste ready
- Include realistic terminal output so readers know what to expect
- Test every command and prompt before submitting

## Reporting issues
